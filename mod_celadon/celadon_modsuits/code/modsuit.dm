	desc = "A N+S Logistics mining suit for on-site operations, fit with accreting ash armor and a sphere form."
	extended_desc = "A high-powered N+S Logistics-designed suit, based off the work of Nakamura Engineering. \
		While initial designs were built for the rigors of asteroid mining, given blast resistance through inbuilt ceramics, \
		mining teams have since heavily tweaked the suit themselves with assistance from devices crafted by \
		destructive analysis of unknown technologies discovered on the Indecipheres mining sites, patterned off \
		their typical non-EVA exploration suits. The visor has been expanded to a system of seven arachnid-like cameras, \
		offering full view of the land and its soon-to-be-dead inhabitants. The armor plating has been trimmed down to \
		the bare essentials, geared far more for environmental hazards than combat against fauna; however, \
		this gives way to incredible protection against corrosives and thermal protection good enough for \
		both casual backstroking through molten magma and romantic walks through arctic terrain. \
		Instead, the suit is capable of using its anomalous properties to attract and \
		carefully distribute layers of ash or ice across the surface; these layers are ablative, but incredibly strong. \
		Lastly, the suit is capable of compressing and shrinking the mass of the wearer, as well as \
		rearranging its own constitution, to allow them to fit upright in a sphere form that can \
		roll around at half their original size; leaving high-powered mining ordinance in its wake. \
		However, all of this has proven to be straining on all Nanotrasen-approved cells, \
		so much so that it comes default fueled by equally-enigmatic plasma fuel rather than a simple recharge. \
		Additionally, the systems have been put to near their maximum load, allowing for far less customization than others."

		and what it lacks in EVA protection, it makes up for in strength and flexibility. The primary feature of \
		this suit are the two manipulator arms, carefully synchronized with the user's thoughts and \
		duplicating their motions almost exactly. These are driven by myomer, an artificial analog of muscles, \
		requiring large amounts of voltage to function; occasionally sparking under load with the sheer power of a \
		suit capable of lifting 250 tons. Even the legs in the suit have been tuned to incredible capacity, \
		the user being able to run at greater speeds for much longer distances and times than an unsuited equivalent. \
		A lot of people would say loading cargo is a dull job. You could not disagree more."

		My God, it even has a granite trim. The double-classified paint that's been painstakingly applied to the hull \
		provides protection against shock, fire, and the strongest acids. Onboard systems employ meta-positronic learning \
		and bluespace processing to allow for a wide array of onboard modules to be supported, and only the best actuators \

		The simplest answer is that Roseus Galactic hire more than a few eccentric individuals who know more about \
		visual aesthetics and prop design than they do functional operative camouflage. But the true reason goes deeper. \
		The visual appearance of the suit exemplifies brazen displays of power, not true stealth. However, the suit's inbuilt stealth mechanisms\
		prevent anyone from fully recognizing the occupant, only the suit, creating perfect anonymity. This visual transformation is \
		backed by inbuilt psi-emitters, heightening stressors common amongst Nanotrasen staff, and clouding identifiable information. \

		though it's missing several modern-day luxuries from updated Nakamura Engineering designs. \
		Primarily, the suit's myoelectric suit layer is entirely non-existant, and the servos do very little to \
		help distribute the weight evenly across the wearer's body when the suit is deactivated, making it slow and bulky to move in. \
		The internal heads-up display is rendered in nearly unreadable cyan, as the visor suggests, \
